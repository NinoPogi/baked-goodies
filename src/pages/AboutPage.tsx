      Baked goodies has a variety of cakes for a variety of occassions.
      Birthday, wedding, or any other family gathering you name it we bake a
      cake for it! -H Baked Goodies by H is a cake business founded by Ms.
      Marjorie Hazel Mercado in July of 2021. Already driven with a passion for
      baking and cooking, Ms. Mercado, together with her reliable oven gifted by
      her parents way back in 2013, took the risk of starting a business in
      baked goods. Originally starting with baked products like buko tarts,
      milky donuts, cheesebread, and ube cheesedesal at the start of the
      pandemic, Ms. Mercado then decided to focus on just cakes by July 2021,
      which gave birth to her current business.
